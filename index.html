  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Two-Stage Amplifier Design</strong>
      <p>
        Designed, simulated, verified, and laid out a CMOS two-stage amplifier in XFAB 350nm technology using Cadence Virtuoso. 
        The workflow included MOS transistor sizing based on design specifications, schematic entry, and extensive simulations 
        (DC, AC, transient, Monte Carlo, and process corner analysis). Completed full layout implementation followed by parasitic 
        extraction, LVS checks, and post-layout verification to ensure performance compliance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Low-Frequency Signal Analyzer & Generator</strong>
      <p>
        Developed a USB-powered audio-band (20 Hz – 20 kHz) signal analyzer and signal generator. 
        Designed the schematic, performed LTspice simulations for circuit validation, and executed PCB layout for a 
        4-layer board with proper grounding and EMI considerations. Oversaw fabrication and testing of the PCB to achieve 
        reliable performance across the target frequency range.
